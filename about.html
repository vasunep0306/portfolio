    <p>I am a passionate Computer Science major who just loves to learn new programming languages, as well as how to apply them. I love working with other people due to the fact that I can achieve more as far as productivity goes. I am incredibly detail oriented as I can pinpoint the exact bug in almost any program. I am very adaptive and incredibly willing to go along with the organization's workflow.</p>
